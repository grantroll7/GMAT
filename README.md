# GMAT

This project provides scripts and codes that use the General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) to simulate a finite burn from LEO to GEO. GMAT's API capabilities with Jupyter Notebook allow a Monte Carlo analysis to account for thrust and attitude variation and supplement GMATâ€™s solar-powered propulsion system by optimizing battery and solar array capacity.
